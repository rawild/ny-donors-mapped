# Mapping NY State Political Donors

This project is for the Spatial Data Analysis and Visualization & Geospatial Humanities (DATA 78000) at the CUNY Graduate Center, Spring 2021

## Data

The donor data for this project is produced by matching via [ny-campaign-finance-dedupe](https://github.com/rawild/ny-campaign-finance-dedupe) which is described in [this white paper](https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5299&context=gc_etds). 

It was geocoded using a combination of the US Census Geocoder API and the HERE API.

## Have fun exploring!
